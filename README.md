# Dataanalysis-education-impact-on-male-and-female-students

by this work We are interested in knowing if men and women's chosen field of study affects their finances and job opportunities. We want to ask what each gender's preferred area of study is, how these preferences change over time, and how this preference affects both genders separately. For example, is the field where women are interested the most having difficulties? Are wages lower for these professionals?

Into what fields are women and men getting into? Are these fields changing over time? Does it has any relationship with how much money each gender is earning? Are men/women enrolled in fields where the payment is lower?
